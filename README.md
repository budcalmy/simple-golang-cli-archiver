# Text Archiver

The Text Archiver is a tool designed to compress and decompress text data. It provides two compression methods: Huffman coding and Shannon-Fano coding. The archiver is implemented in Go and consists of several files, each serving a specific purpose.

## Files

### `compression.go`
This file defines the interfaces for the compression encoder and decoder. The `Encoder` interface specifies the `Encode` method, which takes a string as input and returns the compressed binary data as a byte array. The `Decoder` interface specifies the `Decode` method, which takes the compressed binary data and returns the original text string.

### `table.go`
The `table` package contains the implementation of the encoding table and the generator interface. The `EncodingTable` type represents a mapping between characters and their binary codes. The `Generator` interface defines the `NewTable` method, which generates an encoding table based on the input text. It also provides the `DecodeForTbl` method, which decodes a binary string using the encoding table.

### `chunks.go`
The `vlc` package includes the functionality for splitting binary data into chunks and joining them back together. The `BinaryChunks` type represents a collection of binary chunks, and the `BinaryChunk` type represents a single binary chunk. This file also provides methods to convert binary chunks to bytes and vice versa. Additionally, it includes a utility function to split a binary string into chunks of a specified size.

### `vlc.go`
The main functionality of the Text Archiver is implemented in this file. It defines the `EncoderDecoder` struct, which encapsulates the table generator and provides methods for encoding and decoding text data. The `Encode` method compresses a given string using the encoding table generated by the table generator. The `Decode` method decompresses the encoded data using the provided encoding table.

### `unpack.go` (Truncated Content)
This file contains the implementation of the unpacking logic for the Text Archiver. It includes functions to parse the encoded file, extract the encoding table and the compressed data, and reconstruct the original text.

### `pack.go` (Truncated Content)
This file contains the implementation of the packing logic for the Text Archiver. It includes functions to build the encoded file by combining the encoding table and the compressed data.

## Usage
The Text Archiver is primarily designed for compressing and decompressing text data. To use it, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `EncoderDecoder` struct by calling the `New` function and passing a table generator implementation as a parameter.
2. Use the `Encode` method to compress a text string. It will return the compressed binary data as a byte array.
3. Use the `Decode` method to decompress the binary data and retrieve the original text string.

## Extending Functionality
The Text Archiver can be extended to support image compression by adding an image compression method. This could involve implementing a new encoder and decoder specifically designed for image data. With the added functionality, the archiver would be capable of compressing and decompressing both text and image data.

## Compression Methods
The Text Archiver provides two compression methods: Huffman coding and Shannon-Fano coding. Huffman coding is a widely used algorithm that creates an optimal prefix code based on the frequency of characters in the input text. Shannon-Fano coding is a similar algorithm that divides the characters into two groups based on their frequency, aiming for a balanced distribution of codes.

These methods offer different trade-offs between compression ratio and computational complexity. Huffman coding tends to achieve higher compression ratios but requires more computational resources, while Shannon-Fano coding is simpler but may result in slightly lower compression ratios.

When using the Text Archiver, you can choose between these two methods based on your specific requirements and constraints.
